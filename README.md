# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster - Python basics

Using this dataset,  we will analyze what sorts of people were likely to survive the Titanic disaster. At the end, we will apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

Following python libraries are being used
  - pandas: To ingest and clean data 
  - matplotlib: To generate graphs/visualizations
  - scikit-learn: To apply machine learning tools
  - numpy: To work with arrays
  
The machine learning algorithm being used in this example is Logistic Regression.
